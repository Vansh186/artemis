## Installation | How to use the Bot

 **1.** Install [node.js v12+](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_unhandled_rejections_mode) or higher

 **2.** Clone em Fork em Import them Git Bash them...do whatever you wish...just his the fork button :D

 **3.** Install all of the packages with **`npm install`**     |  the important packages are   **`npm install discord.js erela.js`**

 **4** Fill in the parameters, RIGHT in config.json! :D

 **5.** [Download Lavalink](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/798196676405755905/827174915714711572/Lavalink.jar) and download Java 15 (Java 13 recommended)

 **5.1** Run the Lavalink file with: **`java -jar Lavalink.jar`**

 **MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS THE `application.yml` FILE OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK!

 **6.** start the bot with **`node index.js`**

#### **NOTE:**

*If you are having errors/problems with starting delete the package.json file and do, before you install the packages `npm init`*






## Windows start Command .bat file
```bat

Which starts Lavalink and the Bot together via one click ;)

Have it in the Same folder as `index.js` and `Lavalink.jar`
